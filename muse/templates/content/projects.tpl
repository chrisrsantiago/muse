<p>The majority of my programming goes into web application development.  I program in the Python language (because PHP sucks <strong>hard</strong>) for both desktop and web applications.</p>

	<dt><a href="[url controller="blog" action="view" category="parasol-boards" /]">Parasol Boards</a></dt>
    <dd>Python bulletin board script written in the Pylons Web Framework. It is the only Open-Source forum that is written in Python (as far as I'm aware).  It is written based on how I think forum systems should work.</dd>

	<dd>Open-source Mega Man Battle Network simulator licensed under the GNU GPL v3 license that allows users to get online and battle their friends using their favorite chips and navis. It is written using the <a href="http://pyglet.org/">Pyglet</a> and <a href="http://wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> libraries, in order to provide the best cross-platform compatible interface.</dd>

    <dt><a href="http://suitframework.com/">SUIT (Scripting Using Integrated Templates)</a></dt>
    <dd>Web templating framework with some innovative features. It provides a lightweight and powerful solution to this problem by allowing developers to define their own syntax for transforming templates by using rules. </dd>

    <dt><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/suit-pylons/1.0.0">SUIT for Pylons</a></dt>
    <dd>Paster template that is based off of Pylons' default Paster template for generating Pylons projects.  The main ideal stems from the fact that it makes use of the <a href="http://suitframework.com/">SUIT</a> templating engine over Mako/Genshi/Jinja2/Kid.</dd>
