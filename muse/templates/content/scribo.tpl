<h1>Scribo - mini-blogging engine</h1>

<p>Scribo is an attempt at making a blog system without all of the convoluted ideals that systems like Wordpress love to shove upon its user. Scribo itself is very bare-bones, and it leaves you to decide what you want to do, which means that it's strictly based on just writing an entry and getting done with it.</p>

<p>As such, it is not something that is recommended as a solution to those who seek true publishing platforms, and more so a real "personal blog".  If you are in search of a platform akin to Wordpress that houses tons of extensions and aims to satisfy true publishers, then Scribo is not for you.</p>

        <p>Scribo may be found via the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/scribo">Python Package Index</a> and downloaded manually, however installation is as easy as running easy_install:</p>
