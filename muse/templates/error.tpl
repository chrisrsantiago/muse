        <p>It looks like TheUntamedLegend beat you to this page, because it could not be found!  While you and Moon ponder his whereabouts, I'll ponder on what you should probably do:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If you landed here because someone linked you here, you should go back to that website and inform whoever is in charge that they made a silly.</li>
            <li>If you landed here because of me, then that's my fault, and I'll fix it later.  If you're feeling naggy, <a href="/report/">drop me a line</a> about that.</li>
            <li>If you manually typed in the URL, then go back to the previous page and stick to using the navigation bar, unless you are an elephant and have memorized every URL.</li>
        </ul>
